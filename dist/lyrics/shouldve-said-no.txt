Strange to think the songs we used to sing
The smiles, the flowers, everything
Is gone
Yesterday I found out about you
Even now just looking at you
Feels wrong
You say that you'd take it all back
Given one chance; it was a moment of weakness
And you said "yes"

You should've said no
You should've gone home
You should've thought twice before you let it all go
You should've known that word like what you did with her
Would get back to me (get back to me)
And I should've been there
In the back of your mind
I shouldn't be asking myself why
You shouldn't be beggin' for forgiveness at my feet
You should've said no
Baby, and you might still have me

You can see that I've been cryin'
Baby, you know all the right things
To say
But do you, honestly
Expect me to believe
We could ever be the same?
You say that the past is the past
You need one chance; it was a moment of weakness
And you said "yes"

You should've said no
You should've gone home
You should've thought twice before you let it all go
You should've known that word like what you did with her
Would get back to me (get back to me)
And I should've been there
In the back of your mind
I shouldn't be asking myself why
You shouldn't be beggin' for forgiveness at my feet
You should've said no
Baby, and you might still have me

I can't resist
Before you go, tell me this
Was it worth it?
Was she worth this?

No, no
No, no, no, no

You should've said no
You should've gone home
You should've thought twice before you let it all go
You should've known that word like what you did with her
Would get back to me (get back to me)
And I should've been there
In the back of your mind
I shouldn't be asking myself why
You shouldn't be beggin' for forgiveness at my feet
You should've said no
Baby, and you might still have me
