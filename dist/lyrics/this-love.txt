Clear blue water
High tide, came and brought you in
And I could go on and on, on and on
And I will, scars grow darker, currents swept you out again
And you were just gone and gone, gone and gone
In silent screams, and wildest dreams
I never dreamed of this

This love is good
This love is bad
This love is a life back from the dead, oh
These hands had to let it go free
And this love came back to me, oh
Oh, oh

Tossing, turning, struggle through the night for someone new
And I could go on and on, on and on
Lanterns burning, flickered in the mind only you
But you were still gone, gone, gone,
Been losing grip, on sinking ships
You showed up, just in time

This love is good
This love is bad
This love is a life back from the dead, oh
These hands had to let it go free
And this love came back to me, oh

This love left a permanent mark
This love is glowing in the dark, oh
These hands had to let it go free
And this love came back to me, oh

This love, this love, this love, this love (Oh)
This love, this love, this love, this love (Oh)
This love, this love, this love, this love (Oh)
This love, this love, this love, this love

Your kiss, my cheek
I watched you leave
Your smile, my ghost
I fell to my knees
When you're young, just to run
But you come back to what you need

This love is good
This love is bad
This love is a life back from the dead, oh
These hands had to let it go free
And, this love came back to me, oh

(This love) This love that's a permanent mark
(This love) This love is glowing in the dark, oh
(This love) These hands had to let it go free
(This love) And this love came back to me, oh

This love, this love, this love, this love (Oh)
This love, this love, this love, this love (Oh)
This love, this love, this love, this love (Oh)
This love, this love, this love, this love (This love came back to me, oh)
