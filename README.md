# Taylor Swift App

An app dedicated to Taylor Swift.

First, use the scraper to get the lyrics.  Creates a folder called  /lyrics in your directory.  Start it with `python scrape.py`

Run the project with `npm start`

## Features

Currently a work in progress.  I'm using it to try out React and will probably begin by just displaying the lyrics.  As a fun project, I plan on creating a lyrics generator.
